# Prototype Game

A Game i have been working on with some core features. Due to the realization that completing this game would require a subsubstational amount of art and finances, i have decided to move on to other projects and use this one to demonstrate my work

## Dialouge Tree

A dynamic dialouge tree that allows a player to select from multiple dialouge options. The system takes a JSON file and creates from it a tree for each dialouge option. When the player talks to an NPC the dialouge tree for that NPC is taken and for each dialouge option a button is generated. When the player picks a dialouge option we move deeper in the tree and generate the sub tree as buttons

## Trading System

The player can buy and sell goods from NPCs using his funds. When the player clicks on objects that the NPC has, the item will move to the 'Buy' screen and the amount the object costs will be displayed under the total cost, if the player clicks on an item in his own inventory the item will move to the 'Sell' screen and the total cost will be reflected. When the transaction is processed, the sold items will move to the NPCs inventory and the bought items will move to the players inventory
